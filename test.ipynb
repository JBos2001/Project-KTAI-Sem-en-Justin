      "- Combining thirty and eighteen results in forty-eight. This happens because when adding two numbers where one or both are within single digits of each other without requiring carrying over any digit beyond the tens place; hence, 10 plus another nine equates to nineteen (one set) additionally a third ten is added summing up to thirty on top and then an additional eight more gives us forty-eight.\n",
      "- Calculating fourteen with seven results in twenty because each number here falls directly into the same column when adding, no carryover needed due its single digit nature: 10 plus another nine equals nineteen (one set) additionally a fifth ten is added making it twenty on top and eight more gives us forty-eight.\n",
      "- Adding four to six results in merely that simple sum of twelve as both numbers are within the same tens place value, no carrying over required since 6 plus an additional four equates directly back down into those single digits; hence we have a direct addition without any extraction or borrowing from higher values: ten more brings us up to fifteen.\n",
      "- Adding nineteen and eleven together results in thirty because when adding these two numbers with one digit each, there's no need for carrying over as the sum does not exceed nine nor do both individually equal a multiple of tens; thus we simply combine their singular digits directly: twenty plus ten (from 10 + another 9) equals nineteen and then an additional nine gives us thirty.\n",
      "- When adding three times sixteen, it's essentially multiplying the value of six by two resulting in thirteen ones or twelve as they are single digit units with no carryover required due to their manageable sizes under ten: we combine them at base unit place and get eighteen (as addition doesn’t require carrying over).\n",
      "- Adding one hundred plus ninety, which is adding a larger value of 100 by the hundreds or thousands places gives us a sum of one hundred and ninety because these are whole numbers not requiring carryovers from tens to ones place. Hence we simply combine their values: each number remains in its own respective column without any borrowing needed as they're within single digits; so, 100 plus another nine equals the same total value for both hundreds places and then an additional ninety gives us one hundred and ninety or a sum of two.\n",
      "- Now let’s look at fourteen with eighty-one: when calculating this multiplication factored by addition which is in essence, 4 tens times ten plus forty because it's within the single digit range without exceeding nine, we get that eleven (ten) and twenty-nine gives us a sum of thirty-eight as each number combines directly at their respective columns with zero carryovers needed.\n",
      "- Adding one hundred seventy to fifteen results in an overall total of one hundred eighty because this is the result when combining two groups where both numbers fall under single digits and within tens place values, so they simply stack vertically without carrying over: ten plus nineteen equals twenty (for each respective column) then add another nine more gives us thirty-nine.\n",
      "- Calculating sixteen with sixty-one results in seventy-seven because when adding numbers where one is within the single digits and less than a hundred, no carryovers are needed as they fall into their own columns: seven plus eleven equals eighteen (two sets of ten) then combined directly at ones place we get eight.\n",
      "- For two times twelve which results in twenty-four because multiplication can be seen as repeated addition when dealing with single digit numbers and both do not exceed the value nine, hence just stacking them up together without carrying: a set plus another fourteen would simply sum to five (as one ten is taken into account).\n",
      "- Adding six tens or fifty-six comes from combining two groups of 10s in this case; we start with sixty and add twenty more as they are within the scaled values. This process doesn't involve carrying over since both numbers fit neatly without exceeding nine, thus making it a straightforward addition: thirty plus seven is forty-seven (no carryovers needed).\n",
      "- When adding two times fourteen which results in twenty-eight because we are dealing with the multiplication of tens and ones; here too no carrying over since both individual numbers can be stacked directly without exceeding nine, making it a simple addition: ten plus eleven gives us nineteen (one set) then another six more comes to give an overall sum of seventeen.\n",
      "- Adding eight times seven equals fifty-six because multiplication is essentially repeated additions or combinations here at the unit place value where no carryovers are needed as both numbers being multiplied fall within single digits less than nine: ten plus eighteen gives us twenty-eight (no carrying over required).\n",
      "- Lastly, adding six ones to twelve results in thirty because we're dealing with a base of ten and the sum does not require any carryovers. The addition is direct at their respective columns without borrowings or extra place value calculations: one plus two gives us three; this simple calculation reflects an understanding that when both numbers are single digits, they can be added directly into each other's column values with no need for carrying over to the next highest power of ten.\n",

      "For each cube along with its adjoining cubes on all sides:  \n",
      "Top,Bottom + left & right faces are not counted here as these won't be covered by transparent walls. Thus only the four vertical ones will get exposed to paint in Layer_1 which would give 2*(4+3)+(8*9)=14 squares and then for layer two it doubles again because of both layers, so top & bottom surfaces are not counted as they have one less on each side (one square per cube), giving us an additional +6.

The container's walls are transparent with clear coatings on top (one side), meaning we don’t need painting twice as there is just one 'layer', but if it gets doubled, then every 5 layers of cubes have to be painted in total since the first and last rows will not require a bottom/top layer.\n",
